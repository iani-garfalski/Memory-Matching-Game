## Description

This is a memory card game where your objective is to match all card pairs with the fewest attempts and in the shortest time possible. There is also a scoring system to track your progress. Please read the instructions within the game for further details.

## Features

- **Game Start**: Select a category and grid size.
- **Categories**: Animals, Fruits, Icons.
- **Grid Sizes**: 4x4, 6x6, 12x12.
- **Gameplay**: Match pairs of cards until all cards are paired.
- **Scoreboard**: Keep track of your top 3 highest scores.
- **Dynamic Background**: The game's background changes every time you start a new game.
- **Audio Support**: The game includes sound effects for various actions.

## Technical Details

- **Image Fetching**: All card images are fetched from the external [Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/), which is entirely free. The images are cached in `localStorage` for 1 day and categorized by type (e.g., Animals, Fruits, Icons). If more images are needed (for example, when switching to a larger grid), additional images are fetched.
    - Image fetching and caching are handled by the `PexelsService.ts`.

- **Scoreboard**: The user's top 3 scores are stored in `localStorage` via the `scoreboardService.ts`. It ensures that only the top 3 scores are kept, updating when the user achieves a new high score.

- **Score Calculation**: A utility function calculates the score based on the number of attempts and the time taken to complete the game.

- **Backgrounds**: Pixel art wallpapers are AI-generated by Reddit user [iunewind](https://www.reddit.com/r/iunewind/). These are used as dynamic backgrounds for the game. The background changes every time a new game starts, providing a fresh experience each time.
    - The background management is handled by the `useBackground.ts` composable.

- **Audio**: All audio files are downloaded from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) and are free to use. The audio files are played using the `audioService.ts`. These sounds correspond to actions such as flipping a card, matching pairs, and completing the game.
